# Group-Project-1

Our idea was to create an easy way for a group of people to purchase gifts for others without the hassle of exchanging money in person. Weâ€™ve developed a site that lets you do this with ease.

The first person initiates the transaction by finding the item that will be purchased and clicking the Buy button. They enter the number of people going in on the item and then they enter the names of the people buying the item along with how much each person will pay. When initializing the order, the total amount paid must equal the total amount that the item costs. Once they hit Submit, the order is stored in Firebase and an order number is given. Then, the other people just have to go to our site, search for their order number and confirm the amount that they agreed to pay. Once this is done, the order is complete.
